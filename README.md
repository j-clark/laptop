Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

It is based on [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop).

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

* [Xcode]:(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) must be installed.

Base Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-clark/laptop/master/mac.sh
less mac.sh
sh mac.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

In order to ensure consistent Docker environment, it should be downloaded manually from the Docker website.

[Mac Download](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)

**For OS X Sierra + (10.12+) and XCode 8:**

With Xcode 8.0, when trying to compile the gem you may get the error Project ERROR: Xcode not set up properly. You may need to confirm the license agreement by running /usr/bin/xcodebuild. â€” even after confirming the license agreement. This is an upstream Qt bug that can be worked around by following these instructions:

1. Find the Qt install folder
2. Open [Qt_install_folder]/[Qt_version](/clang_64 || )/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf in a text editor

   If you can't find the file, look for it by searching all files for the following line by running grep -rn /usr/bin/xcrun . in the [Qt_install_folder] or [Qt_version] director

   For this laptop script and Qt 5.5.1, you edit the file directly in VIM via the command line:

   `vim /usr/local/Cellar/qt@5.5/5.5.1/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf`

3. Find the line with this text (for me it was line 15):

   `isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null"))): \`

4. Replace line with:

   `isEmpty($$list($$system("/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null"))): \`

5. Save & re-install the gem

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/policygenius/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew_tap 'caskroom/cask'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'brew-cask'

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac.sh` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`,
`cask_install_or_upgrade`,
`gem_install_or_update`, and
`append_to_zshrc`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.
